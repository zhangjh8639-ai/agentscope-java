 * Interface for memory components that store and manage conversation history.

 * database-backed, or window-based storage. {@link #saveTo} / {@link #loadFrom} let callers
 * persist the message buffer through a {@link Session} for legacy v1 sessions; new code should
 * use {@link io.agentscope.core.state.AgentState} instead.
