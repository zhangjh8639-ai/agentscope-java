## Overview

codingagent is an autonomous coding bot you can host inside your own
organisation. Comment on an issue and it clones the repo, makes the change
and opens a pull request. Request it as a reviewer on a PR and it reads the
diff and posts a real review back. Reply to one of its review comments and
it edits the same branch and answers in thread.

Two things make it safe to give it that much rope:

- It never touches your laptop or your build server's filesystem. Every
  session runs in its own throw-away Docker container — `git clone`,
  `npm install`, `mvn test`, `git push`, all of it happens inside the
  sandbox.
- The framework owns sandbox lifecycle. The agent doesn't decide when to
  spin a container up or tear it down — the runtime does, per session, and
  reuses it across turns in the same conversation.

The same JAR runs as a single process for one team's monorepo or scales
across replicas behind a load balancer — the dispatcher, queue and dedup
store can be shared so any replica can pick up any conversation.

Compared to its siblings: it's more locked-down than [claw] (claw runs on
your shell) and more single-purpose than [builder] (Builder hosts arbitrary
agents). codingagent is the one that **writes the code**.

### What it does

- **Issue → PR.** Drop a request in a GitHub issue and the agent does the
  work — clone, branch, implement, push, open or update a PR.
- **PR review.** Request it as a reviewer; it reads the diff, records
  structured findings, and posts one consolidated GitHub review.
- **Iterating in PR threads.** Leave a line comment on a PR and the agent
  edits the same branch in response, replying inline.
- **Several ways to reach it.** GitHub webhooks, a local CLI for trying
  things out, DingTalk Stream, and Feishu/Lark callbacks.
- **Safety rails on by default.** Webhook signature checks, duplicate-event
  drop, per-conversation throttling, model-call budgets, and transparent
  retry on upstream rate limits.

### At a glance

| | codingagent |
|---|---|
| **Use it when** | You want autonomous coding inside the org but the execution must stay off the host |
| **Users** | Many — every issue / PR thread or chat peer is a separate session |
| **Isolation** | ✅ Each session runs in its own ephemeral Docker container |
| **Sandbox lifecycle** | **Auto-managed by the framework** — created, reused and disposed per session |
| **Channels** | GitHub webhook · CLI · DingTalk Stream · Feishu callback |
| **Distribution** | ✅ Single-node by default; horizontally scalable with a shared store |
| **Filesystem** | `SandboxFilesystem` — every read / write / shell goes through the sandbox |

### Architecture

codingagent is built on **HarnessAgent + `SandboxFilesystem`** with sandbox
lifecycle owned by the runtime. A request from any channel maps deterministically
to a `threadId`, the dispatcher claims that thread (or queues the event if it
is busy), and the agent executes inside a per-session Docker container that is
created on first use and reused across turns.

## Channels at a glance

The agent has no UI of its own — every interaction comes through a **channel adapter**. All
adapters implement the same `Channel` interface and share the routing, session, and HarnessAgent
stack; only the transport differs. Pick whichever matches how you want to reach the agent:

| Channel  | Transport                  | When to use                                  |
|----------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| CLI      | stdin/stdout (in-process)  | Local dev, demos, single user                |
| GitHub   | HTTP webhook               | Issue/PR-driven coding & review              |
| DingTalk | Stream WebSocket           | IM chat with the bot (no public URL needed)  |
| Feishu   | HTTP callback              | IM chat with the bot (public URL required)   |

Long-running coding or review work runs in isolated Docker sandboxes; results are posted back
through the same channel that initiated the request.

## Agents

| Agent ID   | Class                  | Role                                        |
|------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `coding`   | `CodingAgentFactory`   | Implements issues, writes code, pushes PRs  |
| `reviewer` | `ReviewerAgentFactory` | Reviews PRs, records findings, posts review |

## Quick Start

The fastest way to try the agent — one env var, one Maven command, an interactive REPL on your
local filesystem. No Docker, no webhooks, no GitHub App.

```bash
# 1. Set your model key (default model is DashScope; OpenAI / Anthropic also supported, see ENV_VARS.md)
export DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=sk-...

# 2. From the repo root, build dependencies once (skip on subsequent runs)
cd agentscope-java
mvn install -pl agentscope-examples/agents/agentscope-codingagent -am -DskipTests -q

# 3. Launch the CLI (re-run this anytime to chat again)
mvn exec:java -pl agentscope-examples/agents/agentscope-codingagent

```

You'll see a banner, then a `You>` prompt. The agent operates inside its own workspace at
`~/.agentscope/codingagent/workspace/` (not your repo) — the pattern is to clone the
target repo *into* the workspace and work there. So good first prompts are:

```
You> write hello.txt with a haiku about Java
You> fetch https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python/blob/main/README.md and summarize it
You> clone https://github.com/owner/repo into the workspace and tell me what it does
You> /exit
```

Workspace, chat history, and config are isolated from your project tree and from other harness
apps (builder, dataagent, claw):

- **Workspace** (skills/memory/sessions/files the agent reads/writes): `~/.agentscope/codingagent/workspace/`
- **Chat history** (per-thread SQLite): `./.agentscope/codingagent.db` (relative to where you ran `mvn`)
- **Config**: hard-coded in `CodingChatCli` — the CLI ignores any `.agentscope/agentscope.json`
  in your project root so a stale file from a different harness app won't override it.

### Optional: review a real GitHub PR

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_...          # PAT with `repo` scope
# in the REPL:
You> review https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/42
```

This routes the request to the **reviewer** agent, which fetches the diff, records structured
findings, and publishes a single GitHub review.

### Optional: isolate sessions in a Docker sandbox

```bash
# Build the sandbox image once (see "Building the Sandbox Image" below)
export SANDBOX_TYPE=docker
mvn exec:java -pl agentscope-examples/agents/agentscope-codingagent
```

Each chat thread then gets its own ephemeral container — safer for letting the agent run
arbitrary `execute` commands.

## Webhook Service

```bash
# Required env vars
export GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret
export DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=sk-...      # or set CODING_MODEL_ID=anthropic:... + ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_...          # or use GITHUB_APP_ID + GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY

# Optional
export TAVILY_API_KEY=tvly-...       # enables web_search tool
export SANDBOX_TYPE=docker           # run each session in a Docker sandbox (default: none)

# Build and run
mvn spring-boot:run -pl agentscope-examples/agents/agentscope-codingagent
```

The service starts on port `8080` (override with `PORT=...`).

### GitHub App Setup

1. Create a GitHub App with permissions: `Issues: Read/Write`, `Pull requests: Read/Write`,
   `Contents: Read/Write`, `Metadata: Read`.
2. Subscribe to webhook events: `issue_comment`, `pull_request`, `pull_request_review_comment`.
3. Set `Webhook URL` to `https://your-host/webhooks/github`.
4. Generate a webhook secret and set `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
5. Install the app on your target repositories.

## Starting a Conversation

Once the webhook service (or DingTalk Stream client) is running, you start a session by performing
an action in the source platform. The agent has no UI of its own — every interaction is a comment,
event, or chat message that the corresponding adapter picks up.

### Via GitHub

The `GitHubWebhookHandler` listens at `POST /webhooks/github` and routes events through
`ThreadIdFactory` so all activity on the same issue/PR shares one agent session.

**1. Ask the coding agent to work on an issue**

In any issue on a repo where your GitHub App is installed, post a comment:

```
Please implement this feature: <describe what you want>
```

- Trigger: `issue_comment.created`
- Thread key: `github:issue:<owner>/<repo>#<issue_number>`
- Routed to: `coding` agent
- The agent clones the repo into its sandbox, makes changes, and posts results as a follow-up
  comment (and optionally a PR).

Follow-up comments on the same issue continue the same session.

**2. Ask the reviewer agent to review a PR**

On any PR, click **Reviewers → Request review** and pick the GitHub App account:

- Trigger: `pull_request.review_requested`
- Thread key: `github:reviewer:<owner>/<repo>#<pr_number>`
- Routed to: `reviewer` agent
- The agent fetches the diff, records structured findings, and publishes a single review.

**3. Iterate on a PR with the coding agent**

On any PR, leave a review comment on a specific line (the `pull_request_review_comment` event):

```
Can you refactor this function to use streams?
```

- Trigger: `pull_request_review_comment.created`
- Thread key: `github:pr:<owner>/<repo>#<pr_number>`
- Routed to: `coding` agent
- The agent reads the comment in context, edits the branch, and replies in-thread.

**Notes**
- Comments authored by the agent's own GitHub account are skipped (`isSelfComment` check) to avoid
  loops.
- While a thread is busy, additional events are enqueued in `SqliteBaseStore` and injected into
  the next reasoning step by `MessageQueueHook`.
- Only `issue_comment.created`, `pull_request.review_requested`, and
  `pull_request_review_comment.created` actions trigger dispatch; `pull_request.opened` is parsed
  but not auto-dispatched, and `push` events are observed only (no agent run).

### Via DingTalk

The DingTalk adapter (`DingtalkChannel`) connects to DingTalk's Stream gateway over a persistent
WebSocket — **no public HTTP endpoint is required**, so it works behind NAT or in a dev laptop.

**Prerequisites — one-time setup**

1. Create an enterprise internal app at <https://open-dev.dingtalk.com>.
2. Add a robot to the app and copy `robotCode`.
3. Note the app's `AppKey` and `AppSecret` (Credentials & Basic Info page).
4. Under **Event subscription**, choose **Stream mode** (流式) and subscribe to the topic
   `/v1.0/im/bot/messages/get`.
5. In your home dir, edit `~/.agentscope/codingagent/agentscope.json` and add:

   ```json
   {
     "channels": {
       "dingtalk": {
         "defaultAgentId": "coding",
         "dmScope": "PER_PEER",
         "properties": {
           "appKey": "dingxxxxxxxx",
           "appSecret": "xxxxxxxxxxxx",
           "robotCode": "dingxxxxxxxx"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

6. Start the service the same way as for GitHub:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run -pl agentscope-examples/agents/agentscope-codingagent
   ```

   On boot you should see:
   `DingTalk channel 'dingtalk' started: appKey=…, robotCode=…`
   `DingTalk Stream connected: <gateway-host>`

**1. Start a 1:1 chat (DM)**

In the DingTalk client, search for the bot by its name and send any text message:

```
帮我克隆 https://github.com/owner/repo 并总结这个项目
```

- Trigger: Stream callback with `conversationType=1`
- Thread key: `dingtalk:<appKey>:<senderStaffId>` (via `ThreadIdFactory.fromDingtalkConversation`)
- Routed to: `coding` agent (the `defaultAgentId` from `agentscope.json`)
- The agent replies in the same DM. Follow-up messages stay in the same session.

**2. Start a group chat conversation**

Add the bot to a group (Group settings → Robots → Add), then **@-mention** the bot:

```
@coding-bot 看一下昨天合并到 main 的那个 PR，有没有遗留 TODO
```

- Trigger: Stream callback with `conversationType=2` (DingTalk only dispatches group events when
  the bot is explicitly mentioned)
- Thread key: `dingtalk:<appKey>:<openConversationId>`
- Routed to: `coding` agent
- The agent replies in the same group. Each group has its own independent session.

**Notes**
- Only `msgtype=text` messages are mapped today; other types (image, file, card) are silently
  acked.
- Duplicate `msgId` events (DingTalk retries) are dropped by `IdempotencyStore`.
- A per-peer sliding-window throttle (`BotLoopGuard`, default 20 events / 60 s) prevents runaway
  bot loops.
- To switch the default agent per-conversation, add channel `bindings` (e.g. route a specific
  group to `reviewer`); see `ChannelConfig.Builder.binding(...)` for the rule shape.

### Via Feishu (Lark)

Feishu uses the HTTP callback model, so your service **must be reachable from the public internet**
(e.g. behind ngrok during development).

**Prerequisites — one-time setup**

1. Create a custom app at <https://open.feishu.cn>.
2. Enable **Bot** capability and copy `App ID` (`cli_xxx`) and `App Secret`.
3. Under **Event Subscriptions**, set the **Request URL** to
   `https://<your-public-host>/api/channels/feishu/feishu/callback` (path = `/api/channels/feishu/<channelId>/callback`,
   `<channelId>` matches the key in `agentscope.json`).
4. Subscribe to the event `im.message.receive_v1`.
5. (Recommended) Generate an **Encrypt Key** and a **Verification Token** on the same page.
6. Edit `~/.agentscope/codingagent/agentscope.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "channels": {
       "feishu": {
         "defaultAgentId": "coding",
         "dmScope": "PER_PEER",
         "properties": {
           "appId": "cli_xxxxxxxxxx",
           "appSecret": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
           "encryptKey": "xxxxxxxx",
           "verificationToken": "xxxxxxxx"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

7. Start the service and complete Feishu's URL-verification handshake — the controller echoes the
   `challenge` automatically on first POST.

**Start a chat** — DM the bot, or add it to a group and @-mention it; the routing rules mirror
DingTalk (thread key = `feishu:<tenantKey>:<chatId>`).

### Session continuity at a glance

| Source                     | What triggers a new agent run                                  | Same-session continuation                 |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| GitHub issue comment       | Any non-bot comment on an issue                                | Further comments on the same issue        |
| GitHub PR review-request   | Adding the bot as a reviewer on a PR                           | Re-requesting review on the same PR       |
| GitHub PR review comment   | Any non-bot line comment on a PR                               | Further line comments on the same PR      |
| DingTalk DM                | Any text message in the bot DM                                 | Further messages from the same staff id   |
| DingTalk group             | @-mentioning the bot in the group                              | Further @-mentions in the same group      |
| Feishu DM / group          | Any text message (DM) or @-mention (group)                     | Further messages in the same `chat_id`    |

## Environment Variables

See [ENV_VARS.md](ENV_VARS.md) for the full reference.

## Architecture

### Thread Routing

Every GitHub event is mapped to a deterministic **thread ID** via `ThreadIdFactory`:

```
github:issue:owner/repo#42   → SHA-256 → UUID → coding agent thread
github:reviewer:owner/repo#7 → SHA-256 → UUID → reviewer agent thread
```

This ensures that all comments on the same issue/PR are routed to the same agent session,
preserving conversation history.

### Message Queue

When an agent thread is busy (currently executing), incoming events are enqueued in
`SqliteBaseStore` namespace `["queue", thread_id]`. The `MessageQueueHook` drains the queue
and injects its content into the next LLM call's system prompt before reasoning begins.

### Sandboxes

Each coding agent session runs in its own Docker container (`agentscope/coding-sandbox:latest`)
using `IsolationScope.SESSION`. The sandbox is provisioned on first use and reused across
turns in the same session.

### Hook Stack

| Hook                  | Purpose                                    |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `MessageQueueHook`    | Inject queued messages before reasoning    |
| `ThreadBudgetHook`    | Per-thread model call cap                  |
| `ModelCallLimitHook`  | Global model call cap (across all threads) |

`FallbackModel` wraps the primary LLM and transparently retries on rate-limit / overload errors.

## Observability

Spring Boot Actuator exposes:

- `GET /actuator/health` — liveness probe
- `GET /actuator/prometheus` — Prometheus metrics
- `GET /actuator/metrics` — metric browser

Key metrics (all prefixed `coding_agent.*`):

| Metric                          | Description                            |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `webhook.received`              | Total webhooks received                |
| `webhook.duplicate`             | Skipped duplicate deliveries           |
| `dispatch.total`                | Agent dispatches initiated             |
| `dispatch.errors`               | Dispatch failures                      |
| `model.calls`                   | LLM calls across all threads           |
| `findings.added`                | Reviewer findings recorded             |
| `review.published`              | GitHub PR reviews posted               |
| `dispatch.duration`             | End-to-end dispatch latency            |

Set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://otel-collector:4318` to enable distributed tracing.
