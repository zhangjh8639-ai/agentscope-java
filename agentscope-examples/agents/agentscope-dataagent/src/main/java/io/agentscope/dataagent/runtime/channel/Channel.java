/**
 * Channel adapter — ingests inbound messages from one messaging platform (or a programmatic
 * caller), routes them through {@link ChannelRouter} to resolve the target agent and session, and
 * delegates execution to {@link io.agentscope.dataagent.runtime.gateway.Gateway}.
 *
 * <p>Each implementation handles one channel protocol:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link io.agentscope.dataagent.runtime.channel.chatui.ChatUiChannel} — direct programmatic / Chat UI
 *       calls (default implementation, no external transport)
 *   <li>Future: Slack, Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp adapters, etc.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Lifecycle</h2>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@link #init(Gateway)} — called by {@link
 *       DataAgentBootstrap#start} to inject the auto-wired
 *       {@link Gateway} before start-up. Implementations should store the gateway and perform any
 *       pre-connection setup. The default is a no-op for channels that receive the gateway at
 *       construction time (e.g. {@code ChatUiChannel}).
 *   <li>{@link #start()} — connects to the external event source (webhook endpoint, long-poll,
 *       websocket, etc.) and begins dispatching inbound messages. Programmatic channels (e.g.
 *       {@code ChatUiChannel}) may implement this as a no-op.
 *   <li>{@link #stop()} — disconnects and releases resources.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Message dispatch</h2>
 *
 * Implementations call {@link io.agentscope.dataagent.runtime.gateway.Gateway#run} with the {@link
 * io.agentscope.dataagent.runtime.gateway.MsgContext} produced by {@link ChannelRouter#resolveRoute}. The
 * returned {@link Msg} reply is delivered back to the originating platform by the channel adapter.
