        ## How this folder works

        This folder *is* the agent. Anything you put here is picked up at runtime — there is
        no separate config to keep in sync.

        - **`AGENTS.md`** — this file. Edit the system prompt and behavioral rules in
          place; they are loaded on the next session.
        - **`tools.json`** — declare which built-in tools the agent may call. See the
          generated file for the available tool ids and an `allow` / `deny` example.
        - **`skills/`** — each subfolder is a skill: a Markdown playbook the agent can
          invoke by name. A starter `example-skill/SKILL.md` is included.
        - **`subagents/`** — sub-agent definitions for delegated work. See
          `subagents/README.md`.
        - **`memory/`** — long-term memory store managed by the runtime; you usually do
          not edit it by hand.

        ## Authoring tips

        - Keep this prompt focused on *what the agent does* and *how it should behave*.
          Push examples, schemas, and one-shot instructions into skills.
        - When you change tools or skills, current sessions keep their old wiring until
          reset; new sessions pick up the change immediately.

        A skill is a named playbook the agent can invoke by referring to this file. The
        folder name (`example-skill`) is the skill id.

        ## When to use

        Describe the situations in which the agent should reach for this skill. Be
        concrete — the runtime feeds this section back to the agent when it is selecting
        between skills.

        ## Steps

        1. State the inputs the skill needs.
        2. Describe the work — what files to read, what to write, what to summarize.
        3. State the expected output format.

        Delete this file once you have authored your own skills.

        # Subagents

        Each `*.md` file in this directory defines a subagent the parent agent may
        delegate to. The file name (without extension) is the subagent id; the front
        matter declares its system prompt and tool allowlist.

        Example skeleton:

        ```markdown
        ---
        name: researcher
        description: Investigates a question and returns a written summary.
        tools: [read_file, grep_files, glob_files]
        ---

        You are a research specialist. Stay focused on the task you receive; do not
        edit files directly.
        ```

        Delete this README once you have added real subagents.
