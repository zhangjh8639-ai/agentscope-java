 * SPI for enumerating the subagents available to this process.
 *
 * <p>Why an SPI: a built {@code HarnessAgent} does not expose its registered subagent list — the
 * orchestration captures the entries inside {@code SubagentsMiddleware} and the middleware itself
 * keeps them private. Applications opt in by exposing {@link io.agentscope.harness.agent.middleware.SubagentEntry}
 * or {@link io.agentscope.harness.agent.subagent.SubagentDeclaration} as Spring beans (picked up
 * by the default {@link SpringSubagentInventory}), or by providing their own
 * {@code SubagentInventory} implementation.
