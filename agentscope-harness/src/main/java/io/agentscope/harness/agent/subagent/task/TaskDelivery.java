/**
 * Snapshot of a terminal-state subagent task awaiting (or undergoing) push delivery to the parent
 * agent's reasoning loop. Returned by {@link TaskRepository#findPendingDeliveries} so that
 * middleware can render it into a synthetic {@code <system-reminder>} message without re-querying
 * the underlying record.
 *
 * <p>Fields are denormalised from {@link TaskRecord} on purpose — the consumer
 * ({@code SubagentsMiddleware}) only needs the projection, and snapshotting up-front avoids racing
 * with a later status mutation.
 *
 * @param taskId        task identifier
 * @param agentId       which subagent type produced this result (may be {@code null} on legacy
 *                      records)
 * @param status        terminal status — one of COMPLETED / FAILED / CANCELLED
 * @param result        completion payload; {@code null} for FAILED / CANCELLED
 * @param errorMessage  failure message; {@code null} for COMPLETED / CANCELLED
 * @param completedAt   wall-clock instant the task reached its terminal status (best-effort —
